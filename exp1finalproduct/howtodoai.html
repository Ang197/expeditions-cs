        <p id="info">Vindinium is a game where you create an A.I to fight
        against other player's who also have an A.I bot. As the player, you need to be able code-in certain commands for your bot
        in order to gain victory in the match. Some of these commands could include killing the player closest to you, killing the player with
        most amount of gold, taking all other players' mines, or having to go to a tavern in order to heal your bot.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="info">
        <p>There are three main sections of the code for my bot. The first part defines the global data that rest of the code uses. The second part figures out what task to do. The third part tells how to do each task.</p>




        <pre style="margin-top: 100px;"><code>
var enemyBots = [];
if (bot.yourBot.id != 1) enemyBots.push(bot.bot1);
if (bot.yourBot.id != 2) enemyBots.push(bot.bot2);
if (bot.yourBot.id != 3) enemyBots.push(bot.bot3);
if (bot.yourBot.id != 4) enemyBots.push(bot.bot4);
        </code></pre>
        <p>In the first set above, each if statment indicates the list of enemies during a game. The bot would look through a list of players that are present in the game,
        and depending on which one you are, the bot only select those who are enemies and not you. With the bot.yourBot.id, it would simply find one of the four 
        players as you instead of the other 3. From there, it would pushout the identification of you being the enemy.</p> 




        <pre style="margin-top: 100px;"><code>
var richestBot = enemyBots[0];
for (var i = 0; i < enemyBots.length; i++) {
    if (enemyBots[i].gold > richestBot.gold) {
        richestBot = enemyBots[i];
    }
}
        </code></pre>
        <p>The section of my code figures out who the richest enemy bot is. It uses an already-existing array called enemyBots. This array contains several objects, each of which 
        represents one of the enemies in the game. The first thing it does is assumes that the first enemy in the array (the one at index 0) has the most gold. This enemy gets stored in the variable
        richestBot. Then I use a for-loop, which iterates through the enemyBots array. This means that it runs the same procedure on each enemy bots. Since the for-loop assumes that the first bot
        has the most gold, it might no necessarly store in the richest bot. Therefore, it has to compare itself to the rest of the bots in the array to see if they have more gold. On each iteration, 
        if the bot we're looking at has more gold than the one we think is the richest, we update on the variable richestBot to store the one that we were looking at. Once the for-loop has iterated through 
        the entire array, the richestBot variable will accurately refer to the enemy with the most gold.</p>




        <pre style="margin-top: 100px;"><code>
var closestBot = enemyBots[0];
for (var i = 0; i < enemyBots.length; i++) {
    if (bot.findDistance(myPos, closestBot.posArray) > bot.findDistance(myPos, closestBot[i].posArray)) {
        closestBot = enemyBots[i];
    }
}
        </code></pre>
        <p>This code works similar to the code that figures out the richest bot, except it looks for the closest enemy bot by comparing the distance of each enemy from my bot. </p>




        <pre style="margin-top: 100px;"><code>
var task;
if (bot.yourBot.life < 35) {
    task = "health";
}
// 
else if (bot.yourBot.life > closestBot.life && bot.findDistance(myPos.closestBot.posArray) < 5) {
    task = "attack closest";
}
else if (bot.yourbot.life >= 90) {
    task = "killRichest";
}
else {
    task = "freeMines";
}
        </code></pre>
        <p>These lines of code decide what my bot should do each turn. The first line creates a variable called task. This variable can get assigned a different value each turn 
        depending on certain condtions. The first priority is to see if my bot needs to heal because it is important not to die (and lose all its mines). If my bot has less than 
        35 health, it will set task to "health".</p>
        <p>Then it considers attacking the closest enemy bot. It accomplishs this by checking for two things. It first checks to see if I have more health than the closest bot (which
        was figured out earlier). This is important because if the enemy bot has more health than me, I will probably die, and it would not be a good idea to attack them. The other thing
        it checks for is that the closest enemy is less than 3 spaces away from mine (a distance of 2 means they are right next to each other). It does this because I want my bot to be 
        more defensive, so I want it only to attack bots that are really close to me. If both of these conditions are fulfilled, then task would be set to attacking the closest bot.</p>
        <p>The final thing it considers is destorying the richest bot. This is because killing an enemy bot will give me all of their mines, and the richest probably has the most. However,
        the richest player is also probably very good, I only want to attack them if my health is near full. If none of these are good options, my bot will just search for free mines to claim.</p>
        <!-- Broad explanation, significance(why its important), explaination on how it works-->



        <pre style="margin-top: 100px;"><code>
else if (task === "health") {
    var closestTavern = bot.taverns[0];
    for (var i = 0; i < bot.tavern.length; i++) {
        if (bot.findDistance(myPos, closestTavern) > bot.findDistance(myPos, bot.taverns[i])) {
            closestTavern = bot.taverns[i];
        }
    }
    console.log("Getting Health!");
    myDir = bot.findPath(myPos, closestTavern);
}
        </code></pre>
        <p>The final section of my code figures out how to do the task that my bot is assigned. I'm not going to go into detail on how all of it works, but I will explain how one part of it works, because
        the rest is really similar. This particular portion figures out how to heal by looking for the closest tavern and going there. The algorithm for finding the closest tavern is simlar to the one for
        finding the richest bot, except it compares the distance between my bot and each tavern. After that, it sets a direction towards the taverns so that it can eventually get there. </p>

        <p>With A.I, I learned that they need a lot of code for a certain task to happen. You would need a crazy amount of code like for-loops, if-statements, and variables, just to do a simple task.
        I also learned that computers aren't as smart as we are, mainly because they will only do exactly what they are told. It is up to us to create and tell them their instructions. Finally, I
        learned how much time is needed to program instructions for particular action.</p>
        <p>In terms of technical skills, I learned how find the minimum or maximum value in an array by using a for-loop and an if-statement. I also learned how to assign tasks using a variable and 
        multiple conditional statements (if-statements and else-if statements). </p>
