                <li class="list">Starting off is probably the most basic when making a website, which is simply finding a good way to structure the entire thing. Whether that would be the way I would organize the list, place images, or simply just being able to place or change the size of my text, its really important to know the basics when it comes to making a website.</li>
                <li class="list">The other thing to remember, is simply the types of html and css codes for the website. Whether that would be puting certain tags like headers or paragraphs or css codes like text-align or background edits, its the most simple idea to remember since each code is the core and body part of the website's creation</li>
                <li class="list">Finally, probably the most important thing to know is simply the entire design of the website. I need to rememember this because, its the more essential and basic idea of creating a webpage. You simply don't want to create a boring page with just a load of text and info, you would simply need to able to stylize the entire page(or pages) to give off more interest to your viewers. Whether that would be give colorful or nice backgrounds or a navbar linked to different pages, this kind of a rule is essential and makes the most sense for the presentation of it or just to make it a lot more interesting or interactive</li>
